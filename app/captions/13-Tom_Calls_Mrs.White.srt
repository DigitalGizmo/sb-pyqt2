Mrs. Mildred White: Hello. White residence. <br/> 
Tom: Is Dr. Freeman there? <br/> 
Mrs. Mildred White: Why yes, how did you know? He's right <br/> 
Tom: I gotta talk to him.  <br/> 
Mrs. Mildred White: O dear all right…(off phone) It's for you, Doctor.  <br/>
Dr. Freeman: Yes? <br/> 
Tom: We got a fire, Doctor, and Mikey's coughing and coughing. You know the smoke… <br/> 
Dr. Freeman: Who is this? <br/> 
Tom: Tom Libby. The barn's burned, we're Ok, but you better see Mikey. <br/> Dr. Freeman: All right, Tom. Keep him sitting up and give him some water, <br/> 
if he'll take it. And why don't you sit down and have a glass of water, too. <br/> 
I'm glad you found me. I'll be right over.
