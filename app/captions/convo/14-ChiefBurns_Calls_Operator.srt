Chief Burns: Operator, it's Chief Burns. I know half the town is calling, <br/> 
so please reassure people; no people or animals were harmed, but the barn burned to the ground.<br/> 
No one will be at the station for a bit until we get cleaned up here, so any emergencies, <br/> 
ring me here at the Libby's, please. Thanks, Bye
